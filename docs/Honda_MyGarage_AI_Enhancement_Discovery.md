## Current User Journey
### Account Setup & Product Registration
1. **Initial Access Friction**
   - Two-factor verification required for both email and phone number
   - Creates immediate frustration and friction in the onboarding process

2. **Product Registration Challenges**
   - Requires detailed knowledge of Model & Trim or VIN/Serial Numbers
   - Support information (?) links redirect to separate support articles
   - Navigation back to product registration requires restarting the process

### Support Experience Pain Points
1. **Search Functionality Limitations**
   - Support and FAQ sections rely on basic keyword matching
   - Limited to existing support articles
   - No intelligent query understanding or LLM integration

2. **Product-Specific Information Issues**
   - Despite product registration, support articles provide generic responses
   - References to Owner's Manual without direct links to relevant sections
   - Manual PDF navigation required for specific information

3. **Support Channel Inconsistencies**
   - Power Equipment support limited to email, letter, or phone
   - Automotive support offers Live Agent and Virtual Assistant options
   - Live Agent chat only available on specific pages
   - Virtual Assistant limited to automotive products only

4. **Support Experience Gaps**
   - Live Agent requires email despite user being logged in
   - Virtual Assistant lacks Owner's Manual information training
   - Dealer information inconsistencies (showing permanently closed service departments)
   - Geolocation data not effectively utilized across support channels
   - Inaccurate dealer location recommendations

## Problem Statement
The current MyGarage platform fails to deliver an optimal customer experience due to several critical issues:

1. **Fragmented User Experience**
   - Platform fails to serve as a true one-stop-shop for Honda product ownership
   - Users must navigate multiple channels and platforms to complete basic ownership tasks
   - Lack of integration between different aspects of vehicle ownership (service, support, documentation)

2. **Inadequate Personalization**
   - Repeated requests for information already provided during registration
   - Failure to leverage existing user data for personalized experiences
   - Inconsistent use of user context across different platform features

3. **Limited Self-Service Capabilities**
   - Over-reliance on redirecting users to Owner's Manuals
   - Basic keyword-based search functionality
   - Lack of intelligent, context-aware information retrieval

4. **Support System Limitations**
   - Inconsistent support channel availability across product categories
   - Limited real-time support options
   - Inability to handle service booking despite being a core platform feature
   - Support agents lack access to user context and history

5. **Trust Erosion**
   - Multiple failed attempts to resolve customer issues
   - Inconsistent experience across different product categories
   - Lack of seamless integration between platform features
   - Negative impact on brand perception due to poor platform performance

These issues collectively undermine the platform's core purpose of enhancing the Honda ownership experience and creating a cohesive ecosystem for Honda product owners.
